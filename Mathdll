/*
 * Differences between exe and dll
 * Exe has a Main method, dll doesn't
 * exe can run by itself, dll cannot
 * exe: client app, dll: server (serve functionality)
 * exe: memory allocation, thread, process. dll: in proc (in process) meaning it doesn't have its own
 * space but uses the space of the exe that uses it
