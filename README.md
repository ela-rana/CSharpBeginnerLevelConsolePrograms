# C# Beginner (and some Intermediate) Level Console Programs

This repository consists of practice programs and examples of individual topics related to beginner level C# programming
They were all coded using C# Console App on .NET Framework 4.8 on Visual Studio 2022.
Some files are complete with commented documentation, while others are a work in progress that I have uploaded here to back up my notes as I learn new topics.
